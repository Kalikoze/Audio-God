## Synopsis
This is a fun and free application that serves as an introduction for artists creating beats and altering sounds.  The application was developed using React, Redux, Firebase, the Web Audio Api, and the WAD(Web Audio DAW) Javascript library.  This was a personal project developed for a class at the Turing School of Software and Design.   

## Usage
This application is similar to a drum machine in that you can use the arrow keys to play different sounds.  It is also similar to a digital DAW in that a user can mix and manipulate sounds just as one would on a real soundboard.  The user can change sounds using the sound library and assigning new sounds to each track.  Each of these sounds can be altered by clicking the track you want to edit, and moving the knobs in the audio effects section to manipulate the sound.  This can include adding echo, distortion, and the fade in of the track.  A user can even change the tempo of the sound.  

## History
* Angle of knobs for audio effects now change based on the settings for each track
* Created two more effects to change the tempo or add distortion to the track
* Added audio visualizer that reflects what is currently being played
* Created effects to change the echo, delay, wetness, and fade in of sound
* Able to remove sounds from tracks or reassign them
* Can now change the volume of the sound or mute it
* Added ability to assign a sound to a track and be able to play the sound using one of the arrow keys
* Created a sound library to choose both melodic and drum sounds from
* Added ability to login or create an account
* Stylized all elements using CSS and Adobe Photoshop
* Created basic layout of application
